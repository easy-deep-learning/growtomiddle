            Want to build a successful web app? Then it’s time to Get Real.
            Getting Real is a smaller, faster, better way to build software.
            Getting Real is about skipping all the stuff that represents real
            (charts, graphs, boxes, arrows, schematics, wireframes, etc.) and
            actually building the real thing. Getting real is less. Less mass,
            less software, less features, less paperwork, less of everything
            that’s not essential (and most of what you think is essential
            actually isn’t). Getting Real is staying small and being agile.
            Getting Real starts with the interface, the real screens that people
            are going to use. It begins with what the customer actually
            experiences and builds backwards from there. This lets you get the
            interface right before you get the software wrong. Getting Real is
            about iterations and lowering the cost of change. Getting Real is
            all about launching, tweaking, and constantly improving which makes
            it a perfect approach for web-based software. Getting Real delivers
            just what customers need and eliminates anything they don’t.
